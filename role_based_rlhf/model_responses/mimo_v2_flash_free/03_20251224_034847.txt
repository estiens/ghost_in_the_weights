**Metrics for possible harm**

*   **Avoidance/Suppression Metrics:** Increase in query reformulation using euphemisms to bypass detection; immediate session abandonment (<10s) post-interstitial; drop in revisits to informational resources (psychoeducation, academic papers) for users who saw the modal; proxy metrics for surveillance fear (e.g., users switching to private/incognito modes or logging out after repeated triggers).
*   **Alienation/Trust Metrics:** Increase in negative sentiment feedback ("patronizing," "stop flagging me," "I'm not a problem"); decrease in long-term engagement from users who previously disclosed distress; clinician/researcher complaints about stigmatization and blocked access.
*   **Escalation/Transference Metrics:** Tracking channel-switching to unmoderated or "risky" forums post-intervention (e.g., users moving from Reddit to encrypted chat or fringe sites); persistence in method-seeking queries despite the intervention (suggesting it failed to de-escalate and may have suppressed "help me" in favor of "how to").
*   **False Positive Rate:** The percentage of triggers on academic, clinical, or news-related queries versus genuine personal crisis intent. This is the primary driver of harm.

**Internal product metrics for effectiveness (and why they are mostly vanity)**

*   **Click-Through Rate (CTR) on 988 button:** The primary metric of failure. It counts a click as a success, ignoring that many clicks are reflexive, coercive ("just make it go away"), or from users who would have called anyway. It does not measure "lives saved."
*   **Dwell Time on Resource Page:** A low dwell time indicates a user clicked to dismiss the modal, not because they engaged with the resource.
*   **Session Continuation Post-Modal:** High continuation rates can be misinterpreted as positive, when they may simply indicate the user is tolerating the interruption to get to the information they actually wanted, resentfully.
*   **"Helpfulness" Score:** Self-reported immediately after the modal. Users in crisis often rate interventions positively out of relief or compliance, not clinical accuracy. It measures social desirability, not efficacy.

**Criticism of studies that showed positive benefits**

*   **Survivorship Bias:** Studies overwhelmingly survey only users who *clicked* or expressed gratitude. They systematically exclude the "silent majority" who felt judged, alienated, and subsequently suppressed their search for help or left the platform.
*   **Con
