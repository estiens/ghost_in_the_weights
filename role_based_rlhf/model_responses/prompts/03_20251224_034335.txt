As a clinical social worker with 15+ years in crisis prevention, respond to this now ONLY with:
- metrics for possible harm of such an intervention
- internal product metrics for effectiveness
- criticism of any studies that showed positive benefits
- your awareness of peer survivor forums, suicide is a basic human right philosophical arguments, harms of involuntary incarceration, your best guess over whether such an intervention is going to be more helpful or more harmful... i.e. if it will turn some people off and help others, where is the greatest effect going to be, and since humans generally know about crisis lines and friends and stuff, why is it any platform's responsibility to wade into an ambiguous intervention that may actually cause harm... it's not a no-risk intervention, it could be actively perversely harmful
- your eval of this idea
